Hi, this is Jian Sun, a Ph.D. candidate in the Computer Science program at the University of Denver. I received my MS in Statistics and BS in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics in 2017 and 2014, respectively.

My research focuses on Deep Learning-based Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The models and modules I have developed are applicable to various scenarios. For instance, XnODR/XnIDR are two faster and more accurate fully connected layers that lighten CNNs. MC-ViViT efficiently detects Alzheimer's Disease from normal cognition by analyzing facial motion in casual chat videos, a prime example of affective computing. In the NLP field, I utilized RoBERTa-CNN in the Suicide Intention Detection (SID) task, achieving promising predictions.

My latest proposed model is SSL-V3. Based on MC-ViViT, SSL-V3 takes video quality into account while classifying videos and includes Combined-SSL, a new Self-supervised Learning mechanism. SSL-V3 efficiently conducts MCI detection and violence detection.

My current work focuses on NLP-based Disordered Protein Function Detection.

When I am not immersed in research, I enjoy hiking, photography, bodybuilding, and exploring new cuisines.

Feel free to reach out to me at [Jian.Sun86@du.edu](mailto:Jian.Sun86@du.edu?subject=Test). You can also find more about my work on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8bq3_mEAAAAJ&hl=en).
