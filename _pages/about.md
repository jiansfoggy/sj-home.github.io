Hi, this is Jian Sun, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science program in the University of Denver. I received MS in Statistics and BS in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics in 2017 and 2014.

My research focues on the Deep Learning-based Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). My developed models or modules are applicable to many scenarios. For instance, XnODR/XnIDR are two faster and more accurate Fully Connected layers, lightening the CNNs. MC-ViViT detects Alzheimer's Disease from normal congition efficently by analyzing facial motion in the casual chat video. This is a very good application of affective computing. In the NLP field, I utilized RoBERTa-CNN in the Suicide Intention Detection (SID) task and achieved promising prediction.

My latest proposed model is SSL-V3. Based on MC-ViViT, SSL-V3 refers to the video quality while classifying videos, containing Combined-SSL, a new Self-supervised Learning mechanism. SSL-V3 conducts MCI detection and violence detection efficiently. 

My current work focuses on NLP-based Disordered Protein Function Detection.

When I am not immersed in research, I enjoy hiking, photography, bodybuilding, and exploring new cuisines.
