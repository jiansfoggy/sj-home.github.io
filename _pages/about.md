Design a new efficient Fully Connected layer XnODR/XnIDR.
Contribute to detecting Mild Cognitive Impairment by analyzing interview videos.
Research on referring to video quality during video classification.
Solve data imbalance issues by creating the loss function or utilizing self-supervised learning.


Hi, I am Jian Sun, a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science program in the University of Denver. My research focues on the Deep Learning-based Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP). In the Computer Vision field, I developed many efficent modules and models. For instance, XnODR/XnIDR are two faster and more accurate Fully Connected layers. MC-ViViT detects Alzheimer's Disease from normal congition efficently by analyzing facial motion in the casual chat video. This is a very good application of affective computing. SSL-V3 refers to the video quality while classifying videos, containing Combined-SSL, a new Self-supervised Learning mechanism. In the NLP field, I utilized RoBERTa-CNN in the Suicide Intention Detection (SID) task and achieved promising prediction. I prefer to solve the problem at the data level, like data imbalanced issues.

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
