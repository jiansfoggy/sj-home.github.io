- This project proposes MC-ViViT to predict Mild Cognitive Impairment in the early stage from I-CONECT Study videos.
- We design the Multi-branch Classifier module to enrich the extracted spatio-temporal features and capture the visual features from different perspectives.
- We develop the HP loss to address the inter- and intra-class imbalanced issues and help the model pay attention to classes with fewer samples and subjects with short video lengths.
- CONCLUSION: MC-ViViT achieves over 90% accuracy.
