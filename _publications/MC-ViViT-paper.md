**Keywords:** 

Deep learning, Facial expression features, Inter- and intra-class imbalance, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Multi-branch Classifier, Transformer, ViViT.

**Contributions:**

- We propose MC-ViViT to detect MCI from the interview videos provided by the I-CONECT Study.
- We design the MC module to enrich the extracted spatio-temporal features. Its multi-branch structure helps ViViT to capture the visual features from different perspectives.
- We develop the HP loss by combining Focal loss and AD-CORRE loss. The HP loss addresses the inter- and intra-class imbalanced issues and helps the model pay attention to classes with less samples and subjects with short video lengths.
