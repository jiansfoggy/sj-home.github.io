**Keywords:** 

Suicide Intention Detection, Natural Language Processing, RoBERTa, CNN, Data Quality, OpenAI API.

**Contributions:**

- We developed a RoBERTa-CNN model to do SID on the SDD dataset, an online corpus dataset.
- The proposed automatic SID system achieved a mean accuracy of 98%, higher than that in the state-of-the-art methods on the same dataset.
- We find the best text embedding length for the SDD dataset by fine-tuning the relative hyperparameter.
- We used OpenAI API to clean up the dataset due to the key of data quality in training RoBERTa-CNN.

**Production:** Apply RoBERTa-CNN to do SID
