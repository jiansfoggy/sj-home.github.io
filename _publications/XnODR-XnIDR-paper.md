- This project proposes a new Fully Connected Layer, XnODR and XnIDR, by fusing CapsFC Layer and Xnorization.
- We insert XnODR and XnIDR into both MobileNet V2 and ResNet-50 and test on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and MultiMNIST. 
- CONCLUSION: Both XnODR and XnIDR can improve accuracy with the cost of fewer FLOPs and parameters.
